    "The job of a message passing layer is to update the current feature representation or embedding of each node in a graph by propagating and transforming information within the graph. Overall, the general paradigm of a message passing layers is: 1) pre-processing -> 2) **message passing** / propagation -> 3) post-processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` fuction that we will implement for our message passing layer captures this execution logic. Namely, the `forward` function handles the pre and post-processing of node features / embeddings, as well as initiates message passing by calling the `propagate` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `propagate` function encapsulates the message passing process! It does so by calling three important functions: 1) `message`, 2) `aggregate`, and 3) `update`. Our implementation will vary slightly from this, as we will not explicitly implement `update`, but instead place the logic for updating node embeddings after message passing and within the `forward` function. To be more specific, after information is propagated (message passing), we can further transform the node embeddings outputed by `propagate`. Therefore, the output of `forward` is exactly the node embeddings after one GNN layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, before starting to implement our own layer, let us dig a bit deeper into each of the functions described above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def propagate(edge_index, x=(x_i, x_j), extra=(extra_i, extra_j), size=size):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Calling `propagate` initiates the message passing process. Looking at the function parameters, we highlight a couple of key parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - `edge_index` is passed to the forward function and captures the edge structure of the graph.\n",
    "  - `x=(x_i, x_j)` represents the node features that will be used in message passing. In order to explain why we pass the tuple `(x_i, x_j)`, we first look at how our edges are represented. For every edge $(i, j) \\in {E}$, we can differentiate $i$ as the source or central node ($x_{central}$) and j as the neighboring node ($x_{neighbor}$). \n",
    "  \n",
    "    Taking the example of message passing above, for a central node $u$ we will aggregate and transform all of the messages associated with the nodes $v$ s.t. $(u, v) \\in {E}$ (i.e. $v \\in \\mathscr{N}_{u}$). Thus we see, the subscripts `_i` and `_j` allow us to specifcally differenciate features associated with central nodes (i.e. nodes  recieving message information) and neighboring nodes (i.e. nodes passing messages). \n",
    "\n",
    "    This is definitely a somewhat confusing concept; however, one key thing to remember / wrap your head around is that depending on the perspective, a node $x$ acts as a central node or a neighboring node. In fact, in undirected graphs we store both edge directions (i.e. $(i, j)$ and $(j, i)$). From the central node perspective, `x_i`, x is collecting neighboring information to update its embedding. From a neighboring node perspective, `x_j`, x is passing its message information along the edge connecting it to a different central node.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `extra=(extra_i, extra_j)` represents additional information that we can associate with each node beyond its current feature embedding. In fact, we can include as many additional parameters of the form `param=(param_i, param_j)` as we would like. Again, we highlight that indexing with `_i` and `_j` allows us to differentiate central and neighboring nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The output of the `propagate` function is a matrix of node embeddings after the message passing process and has shape $[N, d]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \n",
    "```\n",
    "def message(x_j, ...):\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `message` function is called by propagate and constructs the messages from\n",
    "neighboring nodes $j$ to central nodes $i$ for each edge $(i, j)$ in *edge_index*. This function can take any argument that was initially passed to `propagate`. Furthermore, we can again differentiate central nodes and neighboring nodes by appending `_i` or `_j` to the variable name, .e.g. `x_i` and `x_j`. Looking more specifically at the variables, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `x_j` represents a matrix of feature embeddings for all neighboring nodes passing their messages along their respective edge (i.e. all nodes $j$ for edges $(i, j) \\in {E}$). Thus, its shape is $[|{E}|, d]$!\n",
    "\n",
    "  Critically, we see that the output of the `message` function is a matrix of neighboring node embeddings ready to be aggregated, having shape $[|{E}|, d]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \n",
    "```\n",
    "def aggregate(self, inputs, index, dim_size = None):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lastly, the `aggregate` function is used to aggregate the messages from neighboring nodes. Looking at the parameters we highlight:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `inputs` represents a matrix of the messages passed from neighboring nodes (i.e. the output of the `message` function).\n",
    "  - `index` has the same shape as `inputs` and tells us the central node that corresponding to each of the rows / messages $j$ in the `inputs` matrix. Thus, `index` tells us which rows / messages to aggregate for each central node.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The output of `aggregate` is of shape $[N, d]$.\n",
